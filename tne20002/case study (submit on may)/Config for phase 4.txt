Config for phase 4:

Need to place ip on the following commands repectively:


1) On all devices:

enable
conf t
no ip domain-lookup
line console 0
logging synchronous
exit

enable
conf t
hostname
end



2) ON all swithces:


	a) Setting all normal vlans on switch: (different switch different vlan needed)
	+ (must set 1 access port for all vlans on "access switch", except management vlan which wont have any ports)

	enable
	conf t
	vlan <<insert vlan id>>
	name <<insert vlan name>>
	end

	sh vlan brief


	enable
	conf t
	int <<<<insert port for vlan>>>>
	switchport mode access
	switchport access vlan <<insert vlan ids here and remove symbol>>
	end

	b) Setting management vlan on switch: (different switch different ip)

	enable
	conf t
	vlan 33
	name Management
	end
	
	enable
	conf t
	int vlan 33
	description Vlan for management
	ip address <<ip address>> <<mask>>
	end

	sh vlan b
	sh ip int b



	Setting up gateway: (different router, different gateway, make sure its for management vlan ip)

	enable
	conf t
	ip default-gateway <<ip address for router (in that network port/ subinterface/ vlan).   NO NEED TO GIVE MASK HERE!!ONly NEED IP! >>
	end


	c) Shutdown all ports on a switch and turn on only needed ones:
	(keep the access port for the vlans up and say that in prototype we are showing it is down as we are only showing one pcs, and not all pcs in vlans but in relity these would be up as pcs would connect to them)


	en
	conf t
	int range <<all interface ids on that switch>>
	shutdown
	end

	en
	conf t
	int range <<ones you need to turn on (ie link/ wire port ones on switches)>>
	no shutdown
	end

2)Ljubis switches extra parts: (on all access ports for all vlans)

enable
conf t
int range <<range of interfaces that will have that port security>>
switchport port-security
end


3)Makat switches extra part: (on all access ports for all vlans)
(need to connect a wire between the two access switches and then do stp)

(so would need to fix the topology!!!)

	on distribution switch of makat: (must set for all vlans in makat)
	
	enable
	conf t
	spanning-tree vlan <<ids you want this switch to be primary on>> root primary
	end

(if need be incease path cost between access switch to ensure stp keeps that path off unless one goes down. but i dont think will be needed though)

en
conf t
int range <<interface id>>
spanning-tree cost <<a value greater than default>>
end

(to fix it just write "default spanning-tree cost" there)



4) Guca switches extra part: 
(on switch so no need acl, just give password and username to them only)

enable
conf t
ip domain-name ccna.lab
crypto key generate rsa general_keys modulus 1024

username <<write username here and remove symbols>> privilege 15 secret <<write password here and remove symbols>>
line vty 0 15
transport input ssh
login local
end

(can only test it after management vlan is set up with ip)
ssh -l <<username set>> <<ip of that switch>>


since not mentioned anywhere but is crutial, just do the subinterface part on all vlans too 
+ config all loopback/ server connections too
+
and ensure pingin works on all parts of network now + since packet tracer, make sure to use (dot1q version of the trunk)

enable
conf t
int <<the main interface that will be subdevided>>
no shutdown
end

enable
conf t
int <<the main interface that will be subdevided>>.<<subinterface vlan id>>
description <<desciption/ purpose of that subinterface>>
encapsulation dot1Q <<vlan ID>>
ip address <<ip address>> <<mask>>
end

for packet tracer

enable 
conf t
int <<the port in switch connected to the router>>
switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
switchport mode trunk
end
