Config for Phase 3

A) OSPF MD5 authentication link: see the code from online

B)Bandiwdth on all links: (they said to keep all internal router serial link bandwidth 256)

enable
conf t
int <<interface ID>>
bandwidth 256
end


10/(<<bandwidth>>*1000) = cost

(use this to check the cost in "sh run")

c)passive interface setup OSPF (for all loopback/servers and subinterfaces in internal routers) +set up network parts for all the subnets on the router

	enabling ospf on all internal routers: (keep process id 1)
	(keep router ip as a.a.a.a like 1.1.1.1, 2.2.2.2, 3.3.3.3 and 4.4.4.4 for the 4 routers)
	
	enable
	conf t
	router ospf 1
	router-id <<ip address that you want to set as router ip>>
	network <<network id of subnets on router>>  <<wildcard>> area 0 
	passive-interface <<subinterfaces and loopback interface id>> 
	end
	
	(for network and passive-interface use as many as you need, new subnet to add, new network part, new subinterface port or loopback, new passive interface line)
	
	on isp, dont configure ospf, instead just configure:
	
	ip route <<network allocated as internal network>> <<subnet mask or wildcard>> <<interface or port to makat router>>
	
d + e)Default route to makat isp from makat router: + advertise it

on makat router:
enable
conf t
router ospf 1
ip route 0.0.0.0  0.0.0.0  <<interface to isp>> 
default-information originate  
end

f) Guca router shh setup : (will need to set up acl part as well for it so google that part too (note: the acl will be set on phase 10 part))

(normal router ssh setup)
enable
conf t
ip domain-name ccna.lab
username <<write username here and remove symbols>> privilege 15 secret <<write password here and remove symbols>>
line vty 0 4
transport input ssh
login local
exit
crypto key generate rsa general_keys modulus 1024
end

to test it:
ssh -l <<username set>> <<ip of that router>>
