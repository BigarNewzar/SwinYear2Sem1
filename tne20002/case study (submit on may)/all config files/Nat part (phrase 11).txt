NAT config:
(need to do both 1 and 2!)

1)At first isolate the list of ips you are going to use statically for the server farms.

(for those servers, need thier interface ids)

!
ip nat inside source static <<private internal ip>> <<public ip>> 
!
interface <<interface to that server>>
ip address <<private internal ip>> <<mask for private one>>
ip nat inside
!
!
interface <<interface to outside>>
ip address <<public external ip>> <<mask for public one>>
ip nat outside
!



2) then for the dynamic ones, devide the rest of the ips into equal ip range for each vlans (no need vlsm, instead devide them equally. like if there are 4 vlans, devide the remaining ips into 4 equal parts)

enable
conf t
ip nat pool <<Pool name like POOLVLANXXX>>   <<starting public IP address devided for that vlan>>    <<ending public IP address devided for that vlan>>    netmask <<either network or wildcard of those IPs>>
end

enable
conf t
ip access-list extended <<Pool name like POOLVLANXXX>>
permit  ip  <<subnet for that vlan (thier actual network we set in the vlsm chart)>>    <<the wildcard for them using the subnet they had in vlsm chart>>   any 

ip  nat  inside  source  list <<source  list name like ACLVLANXXX>> pool  <<POOLVLANXXX>>  overload
end


(need to check this part to see which part is considered inside and outside)
enable
conf t
interface  <<serial interface to inside network>>
ip nat inside
interface <<serial interface to external network or internet>>
ip nat outside
end

example from scenario 5: (for no 2)

Configure ONLY on Router Raipur
The NAT Public Address Pool, provided by the ISP is 141.12.2.0/24, this is a range of Ip addresses, divide 3 ways, do not VLSM
Nat Pools for each VLAN                    
                  ip nat pool POOLVLANXXX   starting IP address    ending IP address    netmask ?.?.?.?
                  ip nat pool POOLVLANYYY   starting IP address    ending IP address    netmask ?.?.?.?
                  ip nat pool POOLVLAN1       starting IP address     ending IP address    netmask ?.?.?.?  
NAT Access Control Lists
       ip access-list extended ACLVLANXXX
           permit  ip     source subnet    wildcard   any 
       ip access-list extended ACLVLANYYY
           permit  ip     source subnet    wildcard   any
       ip access-list extended ACLVLAN1
           permit  ip     source subnet    wildcard   any
Establish dynamic source translation by binding the pools to the access control lists
       ip  nat   inside  source  list   ACLVLANXXX        pool  POOLVLANXXX
       ip  nat   inside  source  list   ACLVLANYYY        pool  POOLVLANYYY
       ip  nat   inside  source  list   ACLVLAN1            pool  POOLVLAN1
Specify inside and outside NAT interfaces
       interface  serial 0/1/0
         ip nat inside
       interface serial 0/1/1
          ip nat outside
