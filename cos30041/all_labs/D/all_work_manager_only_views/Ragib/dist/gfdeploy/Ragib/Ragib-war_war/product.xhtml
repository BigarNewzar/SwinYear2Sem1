                <h3> Details about the product:</h3>

                <p> This is a revolutionary piece of technology released by stark enterprises. 
                    <br/>
                    Hence, it can not only let you watch television channels via cable line, but also let you watch Youtube and browse via internet itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Along with that comes Mr. Stark's, state of the art, wired and wireless speakers, created with the capability to produce 3D sounds with 100% accuracy. 
                    <br/>
                    Can you imagine the joy of listening to music so clear that you feel as you're in the show itself, instead of sitting at your home? It's truly amazing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Furthermore, it also comes in with the additional feature of having a prototype AI names Jarvis, a virtual assistant ages ahead of Siri and Alexa. 
                    <br/>
                    Hence, it won't just run your television. Instead, if permitted, it will also be able to take care of your home Wifi, security, privacy and so much more. 

                </p>
                <p>
                    So calling it a television doesn't do it justice. Instead it's more accurate to call it a one in for all technology that can fulfill all of your dreams, instantly.
                </p>

                <h3> Details about the product:</h3>

                <p>PUBG Corporation is an upcoming company that has made a huge name for itself in the Mobile Gaming market via the Game PUBG (Players Underground Battle Royale) from 2016, earning a hefty income. Now, with that success running on its back, the company has decided to dabble in to the field of television as well, to further promote its user's experience. Thus, PUBG Mania was born. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Capability of sustaining high speed internet connection, auto changing graphic levels to maintain 0 lag spikes, and capacity for screen mirroring are just some of the key features that this marvelous piece of technology that sets it apart from the rest. Alongside these, it also provides a large storage space, allowing you to download and store various games and videos with ease. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, since it is new to the market, it has yet to provide a console or any other gaming accessories that can well pair up with the television set, both in terms of style and effectiveness. Thus, it is currently used mostly by streamers who play the game on live stream
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, in short, if you are a streamer who wants a television that won’t buffer and also, live stream and screen cast without any delay what so ever, this is the television for you 
                </p>
